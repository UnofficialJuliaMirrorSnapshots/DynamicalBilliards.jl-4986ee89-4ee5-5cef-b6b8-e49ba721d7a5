abstract = {In this paper we consider dynamical systems resulting from the motion of a material point in domains with strictly convex boundary, that is, such that the operator of the second quadratic form is negative-definite at each point of the boundary, where the boundary is taken to be equipped with the field of inward normals. We prove that such systems are ergodic and are K -systems. The basic method of investigation is the construction of transversal foliations for such systems and the study of their properties.},

abstract = {“Chaos is found in greatest abundance wherever order is being sought.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nIt always defeats order, because it is better organized”$\backslash$r$\backslash$nTerry Pratchett$\backslash$r$\backslash$nA brief review is presented of some recent findings in the theory of chaotic dynamics. We also prove a statement that could be naturally considered as a dual one to the Poincar{\'{e}} theorem on recurrences. Numerical results demonstrate that some parts of the phase space of chaotic systems are more likely to be visited earlier than other parts. A new class of chaotic focusing billiards is discussed that clearly violates the main condition considered to be necessary for chaos in focusing billiards.},

@article{Solanpaa2016,
abstract = {We present Bill2d, a modern and efficient C++ package for classical simulations of two-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. Bill2d can be used for various billiard and diffusion problems with one or more charged particles with interactions, different external potentials, an external magnetic field, periodic and open boundaries, etc. The software package can also calculate many key quantities in complex systems such as Poincar{\'{e}} sections, survival probabilities, and diffusion coefficients. While aiming at a large class of applicable systems, the code also strives for ease-of-use, efficiency, and modularity for the implementation of additional features. The package comes along with a user guide, a developer's manual, and a documentation of the application program interface (API).},
